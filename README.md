# myAdminPortal

I will remove the ghost code soon.

This project is for displaying leave record purpose

---------------------------------
# Sending queue to sent queue

file related
--sts.js
--getRequests.js
DB format for sendingQueue(changable):
stackExample.txt

adding a documentation file
...
Run sts.js: node sts.js

this will get the message waiting in the sending stack and post in the trello.
after that it will be archived in a sent stack. so it is call stack to stack.
